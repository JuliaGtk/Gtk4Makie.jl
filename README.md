A Gtk4-based backend for [Makie](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl)

Combines GTK's GtkGLArea and the GL code for producing plots from the GLMakie backend. All of the latter was copied wholesale from https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl/tree/master/GLMakie.

## Status

It produces a plot with a fixed scaling. No interactivity yet, and hardly anything has been tested.
